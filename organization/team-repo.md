# Team Repo

I've found that having a team repo helps spread knowledge within a team,
and helps outsiders understand the history and future of the team.

## Anatomy of a team repo

#### Mission, Vision, and Members

This readme will allow people to easily see what your team is responsible for.

#### Incubating Projects

Incubating projects exist, side-by-side, within the team repo.

These projects:
- are actively being worked on by the team.
- benefit from greater visibility within the team.
- don't need to be related to each other.
- don't need advanced permissions or CI that would require a new repo.
- don't have a wide audience beyond the team that is working on it.

#### Graduated Projects

Once an incubator project has enough interest from other teams, it's time to
give it its own repo. We put a list of links to graduated projects in our team repo
readme.

#### Any other team documentation

- On Call rotations
- ADRs
- How to make requests

## Benefits

Access -- joining a team no longer requires you to file a ticket to get access
to all the repos you think you need, and then file another one to get access to the
ones you missed.

Up to date documentation -- Documentation is often tacked on at the end of a project.
By keeping docs in the repo, it's easier to keep them in mind when updating code.

Internal knowledge spread -- All incubating projects are in the same repo, so it's really
easy to see how all of them are changing.

External knowledge spread -- As an outsider, it's often hard to know what a team
owns and is currently working on. A team repo gives insight into exactly what
is being and has been worked on.
