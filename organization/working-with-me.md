# Working with Me

In the spirit of openness, I'd like to share how I like to work with others and what my goals are.
This is based off of [Amy Nguyen's](https://amy.dev/?p=979) post.

#### 2020 Goals

My strengths include working on complex projects as an IC and team, making and communicating design decisions, mentoring technical skills, and AWS/cloud technologies. I'd like to hone and refine these.

I see opportunity for faster growth in my weaknesses:
- Mentoring not just technical skills, but career development
- Networking with peers
- Linux subsystems

#### 1-on-1's with my peers

I love learning about, and from, others. I'm also a moderately introverted person. Please drop me a zoom just to chat, especially because I don't know anyone yet! :)

#### 1-on-1's with my manager

I thrive on honest, constructive feedback. Feedback can be negative or positive, and I dislike the "feedback sandwich". I like to focus the conversation on technical decisions, career development, org-level processes, and where the industry is headed.

#### Motivators

I feel motivated when the project:
- makes business and technical sense
- has novel problems to solve
- is collaborative
- is agile

I feel demotivated when the project:
- has external dependencies
- guesses instead of experiments and measures
- is political

#### Hours

I generally like to work from 9 to 5, and take no lunch.
I am happy to hop on a call or slack until about midnight, but will probably have a hard time answering your messages if they are sent before 9 AM.
